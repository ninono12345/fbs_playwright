This obelisk, which is 25 meters long today, if it had been finished by the ancient Egyptians, would be almost 42 meters high and more than 1160 tons in weight.  In other words, it would be the greatest of all. This piece that was left unfinished due to the appearance of some fissures in the upper part of the obelisk, is very important as it shows us how the ancient Egyptians cut and removed the obelisks"
